# CreatorCompanionPatcher

> [!CAUTION]
> I have decided to discontinue maintaining this project for the following reasons:
> 
> 1. I can no longer dedicate sufficient time to project maintenance
> 2. My interest in the VRChat has gradually diminished
> 3. A better alternative has emerged: [ALCOM/vrc-get](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get), which fully supersedes VRChat Creator Companion
> 
> Users are recommended to migrate to the new solution: [ALCOM/vrc-get](https://github.com/vrc-get/vrc-get)
